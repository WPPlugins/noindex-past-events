Automatically add a "noindex" meta tag to past events' detail pages to prevent them from appearing in search engines.

== Description ==

This plugin is an add-on for Modern Tribe's The Events Calendar plugin. It adds a "noindex" meta tag to the individual detail pages for events after their end date has passed, to prevent them from appearing in search engines like Google or Bing.

Note that this only takes effect the next time a search engine indexes your site, so past events may still appear in search results for a few days.
